Created a simple and fun name list with REACT to help learn and understand this library.

![](/namelist.png)

The user is able to add names into the input field and use the "Submit name" button that will cause the onClick to add names to the list.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />


Work in progress...
